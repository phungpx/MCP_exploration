    "summary": "Hyperparameters are a critical factor in reliably training well-performing reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Unfortunately, developing and evaluating automated approaches for tuning such hyperparameters is both costly and time-consuming. As a result, such approaches are often only evaluated on a single domain or algorithm, making comparisons difficult and limiting insights into their generalizability. We propose ARLBench, a benchmark for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) in RL that allows comparisons of diverse HPO approaches while being highly efficient in evaluation. To enable research into HPO in RL, even in settings with low compute resources, we select a representative subset of HPO tasks spanning a variety of algorithm and environment combinations. This selection allows for generating a performance profile of an automated RL (AutoRL) method using only a fraction of the compute previously necessary, enabling a broader range of researchers to work on HPO in RL. With the extensive and large-scale dataset on hyperparameter landscapes that our selection is based on, ARLBench is an efficient, flexible, and future-oriented foundation for research on AutoRL. Both the benchmark and the dataset are available at https://github.com/automl/arlbench.",

    "summary": "Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs), the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning. We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of our main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.",
